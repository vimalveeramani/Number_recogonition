# Number-Recognition-For--MNIST-Dataset-Using-PyTorch

## Introduction
This project is made to learn Deep Learning using pytorch. Here we use MNIST dataset. MNIST is a dataset for numbers in different handwriting.

## Procedure
We import the dataset from Tensorflow as MNIST is a predefined dataset in Tensorflow. This dataset is converted to train, test and validate sets which are used for the same.
Now model is loaded for training and prediction. The training dataset is formed randomly and so is test and validate dataset. The model than trains and predicts the value for testing dataset.

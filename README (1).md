![image](https://github.com/vimalveeramani/Number_recogonition/assets/109494546/288aa7db-32a3-411e-8f3b-933038725c34)


## Description

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large dataset of handwritten digits that is commonly used as a benchmark for image recognition models.

## Features

- CNN model built with PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits
- Training and testing of the model on the MNIST dataset
- Visualization of the model's performance with confusion matrix and accuracy metrics

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-recognition.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the `train.py` file to train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
2. Run the `test.py` file to test the CNN model on the MNIST dataset and visualize its performance with confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.
